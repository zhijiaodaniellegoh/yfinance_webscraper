Most recently, China inked a USD 7.2 B deal with Pakistan to link Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar Port and Kashgar, China.

However, the report notes \u201cweakening linkages\u201d between CRECG and CREC, which is something to keep an eye on in the future. In terms of reputational issues with CREC, the largest issues to be cognizant of are how CREC treats both foreign and imported workers on overseas projects as well as disregard for local communities. noted by the poor conditions described by COVEC employees, and general trends in BRI projects.

According to CREC sources, the company can be traced back to 1894 when China Shanhaiguan Manufactory (now a CREC subsidiary) constructed a railway between Beijing and Zhangjiakou. CREC was more formally incorporated in the 1950s as two separate entities, the General Bureau of Construction and the General Bureau of Design, by the Ministry of Railways. However, these two entities later merged, separated from the Ministry, and became CREC in 1989. CREC filed for IPOs on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in 2007--the same year CREC\u2019s larger holding company, CREC Group (\u201cCRECG\u201d), was formally established.\n\nCREC has been recognized as integral player in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (\u4e00\u5e26\u4e00\u8def, \u201cBRI\u201d), connecting China to other countries as well as developing the infrastructure of other countries. The most notable recent example of CREC\u2019s BRI involvement include its construction on the China-Laos railway, turning Laos away from a landlocked state to major asian trade hub.\n",

The company is headquartered in Guangzhou with an office in Mountain View, California. The senior executive team consists of former employees of Guangzhou Auto, a top Chinese manufacturer, Ford, BMW, and Tesla.\n\nIn addition to Alibaba, which currently owns a 14% stake in the startup, Xpeng has drawn its employees from many well-known tech giants, including Xiaomi, Tencent, Samsung, and Huawei. Their expertise has helped Xpeng become competitive in smart car technologies.\n\nOn November 13, 2019, the startup completed a $400 million Series C financing round with investors including Xiaomi and the company founder, He. On April 13, 2021, the company announced that it was considering making its own semiconductors. Currently, for its P5 model, debuting in the Shanghai Auto Show on April 21, the company buys chips from Nvidia for autonomous driving and from Qualcomm for its in-car digital cockpit.\n",

The company is committed to \"Using technology to improve people's lives in a world where humans and machines coexist\". The company became listed on New York Stock Exchange on May 8, 2014. Drawing strength from its original businesses, Cheetah Mobile is on a strategic upgrading path from the mobile internet to the AI-driven industrial internet and has built up the AI capability for vertical integration, including independently-developed chip computing power, algorithm capabilities, system capacities, app capabilities, and the business brain.\nSpecifically, its algorithm capabilities include the whole-chain speech technology (mouth), the microphone array (ear), the total-sense visual recognition (eye), the indoor navigation platform (leg) and the six-axis mechanical arms (hand). Besides, it has also established three open systems of OrionStar Speech OS, OrionStar Robot OS and OrionStar Arm OS to deliver intelligent service robot solutions based on intelligent speech-based service robots, intelligent delivery service robots, and intelligent labor service robots. Meanwhile, AI-empowered solutions that cover speech, chip, vision, intelligent self-help devices, and indoor autonomous navigation solutions are also provided. With \"intelligent service robots\" and \"AI-empowered\" businesses as carriers, Cheetah Mobile is well poised for the upcoming intelligent upgrading of services and products in the AI and 5G era.

                "overview": "Manner Coffee began in 2015 as a single roadside stall with lines that spilled directly onto a crowded Shanghai street. Today, it has over 300 stores, most of them in Shanghai, and is planning a Hong Kong IPO to raise as much as $300.0 M to continue its expansion.\n\nManner set itself apart by honing in on a younger crowd. It has quickly become known for its creamy flat whites, a chic store design, and prices 30% to 40% lower than Western chains. It's also eco-friendly: Customers who bring their own cup can get a coffee for just RMB 10.0 (USD 1.50).\n\nManner received its first investment from Today Capital in October 2018, then the following year, it began its national expansion after a $12.0 M Series A investment from Today Capital. It added stores in five cities: Suzhou, Beijing, Chengdu, Xiamen, and Shenzhen.\n\n2021 has been a watershed year for the company. Thanks to investments from Temasek, Meituan, and ByteDance, from June to October, it built around 150 new stores \u2014 more than one every day.\n",

Compared to its competitor Dingdong Maicai, MissFresh occupies 28% of the Chinese market and is a more established player in the grocery-buying market, which has seen explosive growth since the pandemic supercharged online demand for fresh produce last year. MissFresh seeks to \u201cplatformize\u201d its pioneering business model \u2014 a nod to the \u201cplatform as a service\u201d business models (PaaS) of Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 by opening its platform to other neighborhood retail businesses and supermarkets, citing a recent \u201cretail cloud business\u201d initiative. Despite having failed to turn a profit since 2018, MissFresh listed on Nasdaq on June 25, 2021, raising $273 million, but its shares plunged 26% on the first day of trading. Its shares continued falling as China carried out its crackdown on private technology companies, down 37% a month after its IPO.\n",
